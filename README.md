# Comparative Analysis of Alternative Splicing across Human Tissues Using GTEx RNA-Seq
## Description
Alternative splicing during mRNA maturation is essential for major biological processes in eukaryotes such as cellular differentiation and proper gene regulation. Here, using RNA-Seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium, we aim to characterize differential alternative splicing events - including exon skipping, 5′ and 3′ alternative splice-site usage - across tissues with the help of LeafCutter and potentially other methods like Cufflinks2. We hope to eventually gain a deeper understanding of how cell fate in different tissues is dictated by alternative splicing, and the relationship between alternative splicing and diseases.

## Software
[LeafCutter 0.2.9](https://davidaknowles.github.io/leafcutter/index.html)

## Proposed goals
1. Running [the sample file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_dRjzD1If9mR0Z6Um5LZTYxVjA) on the LeafCutter website to familiarize ourselves with the software and try to reproduce the example figure.
2. Extending the pipeline to GTEx RNA-Seq data, focusing on crucial genes.
3. Exploring the relationship between alternative splicing and specific diseases.
