# Comparative Analysis of Alternative Splicing across Human Tissues Using GTEx RNA-Seq
## Description
Alternative splicing during mRNA maturation is essential for major biological processes in eukaryotes such as cellular differentiation and proper gene regulation. Here, using RNA-Seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium, we aim to characterize differential alternative splicing events - including exon skipping, 5′ and 3′ alternative splice-site usage - across tissues with the help of LeafCutter and potentially other methods like Cufflinks2.
